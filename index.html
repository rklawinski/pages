  I think that if you can host your own server reliably, that would be the best option if you are working on something small.
  Then you would have full control over your server. If you want something quick and easy I would go with the 000webhosting because 
  they offer a wide variety of different things to help you build your site and you don't have to worry about maintaining it.
